<br />

Sema is a playground where you can rapidly prototype live coding mini-languages for signal synthesis, machine learning and machine listening.

Sema aims to provide an online integrated environment for designing both abstract high-level languages and more powerful low-level languages.

Sema implements a set of core design principles:

* Integrated signal engine – In terms language and signal engine integration, there is no conceptual split. Everything is a signal. However, for the sake of modularity, reusability, and a sound architecture, sema's signal engine is implemented by the [sema-engine](https://github.com/frantic0/sema-engine) library.

* Single sample signal processing – Per-sample sound processing for supporting techniques that use feedback loops, such as physical modelling, reverberation and IIR filtering.

* Sample rate transduction – It is simpler to do signal processing with one principal sample rate, the audio rate. Different sample rate requirements of dependent objects can be resolved by upsampling and downsampling, using a transducer. The transducer concept enables us to accommodate a variety of processes with varying sample rates (video, spectral rate, sensors, ML model inference) within a single engine.

* Minimal abstractions – There are no high-level abstractions such as buses, synths, nodes, servers, or any language scaffolding in our signal engine. Such abstractions sit within the end-user language design space.

## Dependencies

Sema requires the following dependencies to be installed:

 - [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or any Chromium-based browser (e.g. Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera)
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) active LTS version (currently v14.4.0). To switch between node versions, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
 - [NPM cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) OR [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

 In order to run, Sema must connect with an api key to a [Supabase backend](https://supabase.com).
 - You can either install supabase locally by following [these instructions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development), or connect to a [free hosted project](https://app.supabase.io/). We provide more detailed instructions on how to get set up for development on the [wiki](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki/Getting-set-up-for-development-with-Sema).

## How to build and run the Sema playground on your machine

If you decide to use `npm` to build sema, you can follow this list of commands:

```sh
$ cd sema
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run dev
```

If you decide to go with the Yarn package manager instead, you can use the following list of commands:


To use Yarn:
```sh
$ cd sema
$ yarn
$ yarn build
$ yarn dev
```

Once you have sema running as a node application, you can load it on your browser on the following ports
- npm run dev, go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) on your browser


## Hardware acceleration:

Hardware acceleration will have a drastic effect in Tensorflow.js model training speed.

To enable it in Chrome:
* Navigate to chrome://settings
* Click the **Advanced ▼** button at the bottom of the page
* In the **System** section, ensure the **Use hardware acceleration when available** checkbox is checked (relaunch Chrome for changes to take effect)

To enable in Firefox:
- Go to `about:preferences`
- Scroll till you reach the **Performance section**, or simply search for "performance"
- Enable **recommended performance settings**, this will enable hardware acceleration if and when it is available

## Linux Users

Sema uses Web Audio API Audio Worklets. Their performance seems very sensitive to CPU power scaling. If you are experiencing sound quality issues, try setting the CPU governor to *performance* mode. e.g on Ubuntu,

```$ cpupower frequency-set --governor performance```


## Documentation

Sema's _reference documentation_ aims at supporting the users learning experience. It is integrated in the application and comprises the following elements:

* [Default Livecoding Language](static/docs/default-livecoding-language.md)

* [Sema Intermediate Language](static/docs/sema-intermediate-language.md)

* [Maximilian DSP API](static/docs/maximilian-dsp-api.md)

* [Javascript Editor Utils](static/docs/javascript-editor-utils.md)


Sema's [Wiki](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki) documentation aims at supporting contributions. It focuses on how Sema is designed and built:

* [How do the Svelte stores in Sema work?](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki/1.3.-Application-State-Management-with-Svelte-stores)

* [How does Sema implement and use web services?](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki/1.4.-Languages-and-Tutorials-JSON-web-services)

* [How do I create and add a new widget to Sema?](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki/4.-How-do-I-create-and-add-a-new-widget-to-Sema%3F)

* [How do I add a new ML library to Sema?](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki/5.-How-do-I-add-a-new-ML-library-to-Sema%3F)
